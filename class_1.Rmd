## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Understand loops

While loops and for loop:

```{r loops}
# while loop
  x=2
  while(x<1000)
  {
    x=x^2
    print(x)
  }
  
  # for loop
  z <- c(7,19,25,65, 45)
  for( i in z) {
    print(i*i)
  }

```

## Repeat and Break commands

r code to understand repeat and break commands:

```{r}
x = 2
repeat {
  x = x ^ 2
  print(x)
  if (x > 100) {
    break
  }
}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
